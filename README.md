# Housing Price Prediction - Lasso_RIDGE_Regularization
### Problem Statement
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market, in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

### Expected outcome
 * Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
 * How well those variables describe the price of a house.
 * Optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

### Steps Involved:
 * 1. Reading, understanding and visualising the data.
 * 2. EDA 
 * 3. Data Standardisation
 * 4. Test Train Fit
 * 5. Normalization 
 * 6. Model building
 * 7. Predictions and evaluation on the test set
